In this chapter we will use Knative + Camel-k to deploy a simple route that will move __*.xml__  file from one s3 bucket to another.

.Message Filter
****
The Message Filter has only a single output channel. If the message content matches the criteria specified by the Message Filter, the message is routed to the output channel. If the message content does not match the criteria, the message is discarded.

== Demo Overview

The demo has an Apache Camel route configured as **knative serving** endpoint, that gets activated once it receives an event i.e. s3 object (xml file) name. Upon activation it starts a Apache Camel route that applies **Message Filter EIP** to process only the `xml` files. The matching xml files will be moved to another bucket called `top(to process)`, while other files are discarded.

The following diagram shows the pictorial overview of the demo:

== Deployment 

[#gs-make-s3-data-bucket]
=== Make s3 **data** bucket

:s3-bucket: data
:k8s-env: minikube
:k8s-cli: kubectl
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tags=s3-url]

.(OR)

:s3-bucket: data
:k8s-env: minishift
:k8s-cli: oc
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tag=s3-url]

For this demos we will be using a s3 bucket called `data`, run the following command to create the bucket in s3:

include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tags=s3-make-bucket]

Verify the created bucket by listing the s3 storage, running the following command:

:s3-bucket: data
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tags=s3-ls-bucket]

For more information on how to use aws cli with minio server is available https://docs.minio.io/docs/aws-cli-with-minio.html[here].

[TIP]
====
You can also create the bucket via the minio xref:camelk:setup.adoc#minio-webconsole[web console].
====

[#gs-make-s3-top-bucket]
=== Make s3 **to-process** bucket

For this demo we will also be using a s3 bucket called `top` where the files will be moved after, run the following command to create the bucket in s3:

:s3-bucket: top
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tags=s3-make-bucket]

Verify the created bucket by listing the s3 storage, running the following command:

:s3-bucket: top
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tags=s3-ls-bucket]

[#gs-cartoon-messages-mover]
=== Deploy Cartoon Messages Mover

Navigate to camel-k demos in work folder:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd $TUTORIAL_HOME/work/knative-tutorial-camelk/quickstart
----

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kamel run --dependency='camel-aws'\#<1>
  --property 's3EndpointUrl=http://minio-server' \
  --property 'minioAccessKey=demoaccesskey' \
  --property 'minioSecretKey=demosecretkey' \
  link:{camelk-demos-github-repo}/quickstart/src/main/java/CartoonMessagesMover.java[src/main/java/CartoonMessagesMover.java]
----

<1> Because of an existing https://github.com/apache/camel-k/issues/527[bug], you  need to add the dependency `camel-aws`, this will be removed in future.

You can check the deployed integration context:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kamel get 
# the command will return
NAME                    PHASE                   CONTEXT

:kube-svc: cartoon-messages-mover
include::ROOT:partial$watching-logs.adoc[]

[#gs-test-cartoon-messages-mover]
=== Test the Route

[#gs-test-data]
==== Upload test data 

Navigate to the `quickstart` folder:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd $TUTORIAL_HOME/work/knative-tutorial-camel-k/quickstart
----

:s3-bucket: data
:k8s-env: minikube
:k8s-cli: kubectl
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tags=s3-url]

.(OR)

:s3-bucket: data
:k8s-env: minishift
:k8s-cli: oc
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tag=s3-url]

Upload XML file called `message1.xml` to s3 bucket called `data`,

:s3-bucket: data
:s3-upload-file-link: {camelk-demos-github-repo}/quickstart/data/message1.xml
:s3-upload-file: data/message1.xml
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tag=s3-upload-file]

Upload a text file called `hello.txt` to s3 bucket called `data`,

:s3-bucket: data
:s3-upload-file-link: {camelk-demos-github-repo}/quickstart/data/hello.txt
:s3-upload-file: data/hello.txt
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tag=s3-upload-file]

Verify if the XML and text files were uploaded to the  s3 bucket:

:s3-bucket: data
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tag=s3-ls-bucket]


[#gs-invoke-service]
==== Invoke service

Invoke the service by passing a header `fileName` with value `message1.xml`, this `fileName` header value will be used by Camel route to move the file from s3 bucket `data` to `top`. 

:k8s-env: minikube
:k8s-cli: kubectl
include::ROOT:partial$invoke-service.adoc[tag=env]

.(OR)

:k8s-env: minishift
:k8s-cli: oc
include::ROOT:partial$invoke-service.adoc[tag=env]

:svc-name:  cartoon-messages-mover
:file-name: message1.xml
include::camelk:partial$invoke-service.adoc[tags=set-svc-url;invoke-svc]

[NOTE]
====
The event simulation above will be removed once the CamelSource event source is available with Knative Eventing.
====

On success which is usually HTTP 200, you can list the out `top` bucket to see the moved `message1.xml` file.

:s3-bucket: top
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tag=s3-ls-bucket]

Lets now try sending the request for `hello.txt`:

:file-name: hello.txt
include::camelk:partial$invoke-service.adoc[tag=invoke-svc]

Since we process only `*.xml` files the `top` bucket will not have the file `hello.txt` moved from `data` bucket, you can verify the same using the command:

:s3-bucket: top
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tag=s3-ls-bucket]

[NOTE]
====
When the `cartoon-messages-mover` has been scaled to zero; when giving a new request it will try to scale up, it will not be able to serve the request until the pod is up, during such time you might get HTTP 502 Bad Gateway errors, give some more time for the pod to come up before issuing the request again.

Right now camel-k does not add Liveliness and Readiness Probes which can help avoid this issue. There is a open https://github.com/apache/camel-k/issues/525[issue] which is fixed and will be part of 0.3.1 release.
