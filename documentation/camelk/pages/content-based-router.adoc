= Content Based Routing
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this chapter we will use Knative + Camel-k to deploy a route that will parse the content of the xml file that was added to an s3 bucket and routes the message to different endpoints based on the content.

.Content Based Router
****
The Content-Based Router examines the message content and routes the message onto a different channel based on data contained in the message. The routing can be based on a number of criteria such as existence of fields, specific field values etc. When implementing a Content-Based Router, special caution should be taken to make the routing function easy to maintain as the router can become a point of frequent maintenance. In more sophisticated integration scenarios, the Content-Based Router can take on the form of a configurable rules engine that computes the destination channel based on a set of configurable rules.

== Demo Overview

The demo has an Apache Camel route configured as **knative serving** endpoint, that gets activated once it receives an event i.e. s3 object (file) name. Upon activation it starts a Apache Camel route that applies **Content Based Router EIP** based on  cartoon's `genre`. All cartoons of genre `comedy` will be delivered to a knative channel called `genre-comedy` and other genres wil be delivered to  knative channel called `genre-others`.

There will be two message handlers that will be deployed to handle the respective genre messages:

* <<cbr-comedy-genre-handler,Comedy Genre Handler>>
* <<cbr-others-genre-handler,Other Genre Handler>>

The following diagram shows the pictorial overview of the demo:

[#cbr-make-s3-data-bucket]
=== Make s3 **data** bucket

:s3-bucket: data
:k8s-env: minikube
:k8s-cli: kubectl
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tags=s3-url]

.(OR)

:s3-bucket: data
:k8s-env: minishift
:k8s-cli: oc
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tag=s3-url]

For this demo we will be using a s3 bucket called `data`, run the following command to create the bucket in s3:

include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tags=s3-make-bucket]

Verify the created bucket by listing the s3 storage, running the following command:

:s3-bucket: data
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tags=s3-ls-bucket]

For more information on how to use aws cli with minio server is available https://docs.minio.io/docs/aws-cli-with-minio.html[here].

[TIP]
====
You can also create the bucket via the minio xref:camelk:setup.adoc#minio-webconsole[web console].

[#cbr-create-channels]
=== Create Knative Channels

Navigate to the tutorial chapter's `knative` folder:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd $TUTORIAL_HOME/{camelk-repo}/knative
----

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl  -n knativetutorial apply -f link:{github-repo}/{camelk-repo}/knative/channels.yaml[channels.yaml]
----

.(OR)

----
oc -n knativetutorial apply -f channels.yaml

Checking the channels created:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl  -n knativetutorial get channels.eventing.knative.dev
----

.(OR)

----
oc -n knativetutorial get channels.eventing.knative.dev

Upload XML file called `message1.xml` to s3 bucket called `data`,

[#cbr-invoke-service]
==== Invoke service

Invoke the service by passing a header `fileName` with value `message1.xml`, this `fileName` header value will be used by Camel route to process the body content of the file to move them to `genre-comedy` or `genre-others` content buckets in s3.

:k8s-env: minikube

[NOTE]
====
The event simulation above will be removed once the CamelSource event source is available with Knative Eventing.
====

On success which is usually HTTP 200, you can list the out `genre-comedy` bucket to see the file `tomandjerry.xml`. You can list the bucket using the command:

:s3-bucket: genre-comedy
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tag=s3-ls-bucket]

Lets try to upload non `comedy` genre to see the file getting uploaded to `genre-others`,

:file-name: message2.xml
include::camelk:partial$invoke-service.adoc[tag=invoke-svc]

Like before on success which is usually HTTP 200, you can list the out `genre-others` bucket to see the file `theadventuresoftenaliraman.xml`. You can list the bucket using the command:

:s3-bucket: genre-others
include::camelk:partial$minio-and-s3.adoc[tag=s3-ls-bucket]

[NOTE]
====
When the `cartoon-genre-router` has been scaled to zero; when giving a new request it will try to scale up, it will not be able to serve the request until the pod is up, during such time you might get HTTP 502 Bad Gateway errors, give some more time for the pod to come up before issuing the request again.

Right now camel-k does not add Liveliness and Readiness Probes which can help avoid this issue. There is a open https://github.com/apache/camel-k/issues/525[issue] which is fixed and will be part of 0.3.1 release.
